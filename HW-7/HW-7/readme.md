# HW 7 | Describe then Alter the Bouncing Ball

## Description of What the Original Code is Doing

<!--
--This is a Comment Block--

Please describe what the original code is doing.

Why is it working the way it is?
What does each line do?
How can you make the ball change direction?

From lines 1-10, this is where the variables are set up. Specifically, this is where the object “ball” is being set up and defined. Right after that the object is being assigned qualities to it. From lines 12-15 this is where setup is being established setting the size of the window in the browser from width of the page to the height of 400 pixels. The background is set to white. Line 19 is setting up the draw function where the “ball” object will have values added to it.  Lines 21 and 22 are basically “ball.x” added with delta and scale multiplying with each other. Lines 25 – 30 set the speed of the ball within the bounds of the window width and height. 32 and 33 fills and creates an ellipse with the dimensions and position of the objects values. On line 36 the mouse pressed function is being called in which evaluates when the mouse is clicked. The lines after that use the map to alter the direction of the ball by changing the values ranges when the mouse button is clicked.

The last lines is where you would go and change the direction due to the click of the mouse.

## How did you alter the sketch?

I changed the sketch by adding color to the ellipses using the randomizer for the colors. I also altered the mapping by increasing the range to 15 which made it still enjoyable to watch on the screen when changing the direction of the ellipse. Finally I just changed the circle to an oval so that it added more interested to the sketch.
